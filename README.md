# Line Language Implementation in Rust
https://esolangs.org/wiki/Line

Current Version: 0.0.2

This project right now is in a sorry state and currently in active development until it reaches a working condition (e.g. at 0.1.0).

# Necessary Steps to Version 0.1.0
- [x] Read and store line path
- [x] Export image of line path
- [] Refactoring code
- [] organizing code into source files
- [] Compile path into Brainfuck IR
- [] Interpreter for Brainfuck IR
- [] Compile IR to x86/x64
- [] Proper CLI handling


# Project Plans
- text based file format
- more efficient/stable byte format
- options for image mode (e.g. margin/unit sizes, colors, etc.)
- "continuous" mode for animation with image mode
- optionally allow diagonal branching paths
- create path from image
- visual path editor
